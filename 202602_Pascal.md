[20251203 CIRE Spotlight: Jennifer Pascal](https://youtu.be/by9Ic0Laz64)


Professor Jennifer Pascal went to TN Tech for her B.S. and Ph.D., both in
Chemical Engineering. She participated in the NIH Academic
Science and Research Training program as a postdoctoral fellow at the
University of New Mexico, where Prof. Pascal did cancer research and
taught at a tribal college. Prof. Pascal started a chemical engineering
brewery engineering class in 2019, and UConn Brewing Innovation began in
2023 in collaboration with Jen Mathieu (CCEI) and Pete Menard. Since
then, they have grown it to add more courses and experiential learning
opportunities for students.


**CIRE Spotlight Jennifer Pascal-20260211_100415-Meeting Recording**

February 11, 2026, 3:03PM

49m 33s

**Cooper, Ryan** started transcription

**Cooper, Ryan** 0:06\
OK, so now we are starting the recording.\
Bing.\
In.\
I\'m trying to make it so that, yeah, that\'s fine.\
So we\'ll give everyone to a second to come to the recording and I\'ll
start, I\'ll introduce the day. So we have Professor Jennifer Pascal
from the Chemical Biomolecular Engineering Department.\
Um, she has done a lot of awesome work. Uh, across.\
I just lost my yeah across chemical engineering and with the UConn
Brewing Innovation program. She came from NIH academic science and
research training background and before that she was at Tennessee Tech.\
Getting a PhD in the bachelor\'s and PhD in chemical engineering. So
I\'m really excited to hear more about the UConn Brewery innovation and
like all the things that you\'ve been doing at UConn and in your
academic career.\
So thanks for joining.\
I think you are muted.

**Pascal, Jennifer** 1:37\
I forgot to hit the button. Yeah. Thank you for having me and thank you
all for joining. I know it\'s like a busy time of the day, but I thank
you for doing these, Ryan. I think they\'re great. Hassan\'s was really,
really cool a couple months ago, so I\'m looking forward to future sire
highlights.

**Cooper, Ryan** 1:39\
No.\
Yes, yeah, it is really fun to connect with people on this and thanks
for joining us on.

**Pascal, Jennifer** 2:01\
Mhm.

**Cooper, Ryan** 2:01\
So first question for the day is what\'s bring what brings you joy at
the moment?

**Pascal, Jennifer** 2:04\
But.\
Yeah, so I it\'s kind of cliche, but this semester I am working in terms
of work. I\'m working on a lot of more experiential courses in my
teaching, which makes for different interactions with students than
traditional kind of lecture course based.\
Courses. So that\'s really fun, just getting to interact with students
in a different context, like in lab and things like that. So that\'s
been a lot of fun. Also working with colleagues and in my department in
chemical engineering, we have.\
You know, two newer Sire faculty in the department. Genesis is here.
She\'s one of them. And so it\'s been really fun to have that community
to talk about teaching and different challenges we\'re facing and stuff
like that. And then outside of work, yeah, I love to play pickleball. So
that brings me a lot.\
Joy and reading good books so.\
Yeah.

**Cooper, Ryan** 3:12\
What\'s uh, what\'s the latest book that?

**Pascal, Jennifer** 3:15\
So I\'m reading a couple. So I know we have the the author of Empire of
A I coming in March, so I\'m reading her book right now. And then the
wonderful Patti Smith was at Southern Connecticut a few weeks ago.

**Cooper, Ryan** 3:22\
Yes.

**Pascal, Jennifer** 3:33\
Talking about her new book, her memoir. So I\'m reading that as well. So
both really, really good.

**Cooper, Ryan** 3:39\
Cool. Yeah. Broad range of of books. Pickleball is sweeping the nation
and it is very fun, yeah.

**Pascal, Jennifer** 3:46\
Yeah. Have you played?

**Cooper, Ryan** 3:49\
Yes, yeah, I was. We played ping pong one day and I was joking like,
hey, it\'s mini pickle ball.

**Pascal, Jennifer** 3:51\
It\'s really fun.\
It is. Yeah. I love ping pong as well. But yeah, I have a group of
students that plays at the rec center. They\'re they\'re like, we\'re
playing today at 11. We need, we need a fourth. I\'m like, I can\'t. I
would love to, but but yeah.

**Cooper, Ryan** 3:58\
Yeah.\
Cool. And then, so I know a little bit of your background, but what\'s
your, what was your background? What kind of led to this position here
at UConn?

**Pascal, Jennifer** 4:21\
Yeah. So yeah, I\'m from Tennessee originally, so I went to school at
Tennessee Tech and studied chemical engineering. I ended up staying
there for my doctorate for a variety of reasons. And then I found this
really cool.\
Post doctoral fellowship through the National Institutes of Health at
the University of New Mexico. So it was basically a fellowship where
postdocs would spend 70 or yeah, 75% of their time on kind of.\
Biomedical based research and then 25% of their time on teaching at a
minority serving institution. So you had a mentor for kind of each one
of those things. And so I spent a couple of years working on some cancer
research and then teaching at a tribal College in Albuquerque.\
So it was, it was a really amazing experience and I learned a lot from
that. So yeah, I mean, at the time I did the post-doc, I knew I wanted
to be a faculty member, you know, but I I kind of wanted some additional
training in that and like I yeah.\
Wanted to do something a little bit different than I had done so.

**Cooper, Ryan** 5:35\
Yeah, that\'s a really great opportunity. And yeah, I\'m glad you, you
spent some time doing like minority serving institution work. Did that
change like how you see?

**Pascal, Jennifer** 5:47\
Yeah.

**Cooper, Ryan** 5:51\
Students or like expectations for students.

**Pascal, Jennifer** 5:55\
Definitely. I feel like at the tribal college it it yeah. So there were
some students that came. It was open enrollment. So any student that was
like a certain percentage Native American could just like walk onto the
campus.\
Show up, like have housing and food and all of that for free and go to
classes, which is amazing. But many came in with, you know, their
experiences were very they varied a lot. So some, you know, went to like
really good high schools and they were prepared to like do engineering
and all that.\
And then others, you know, did not have that experience. You know, maybe
we didn\'t graduate from high school, struggled with the English
language, right? Because it\'s not their native language necessarily.
They come from, yeah, just.\
You know, very like challenging places potentially. So and a lot of
different different demands like this. Yeah. Then you know what you
think of is like, I don\'t know, a very stereotypical college student
at, you know, UConn or something like that, so.\
Yeah, I think it made me have more empathy, you know, towards students,
for sure. Like hearing some of their stories and yeah, what they were,
you know, trying to accomplish, you know, and going to the the tribal
College and then.

**Cooper, Ryan** 7:20\
Yeah.

**Pascal, Jennifer** 7:27\
The hope from there is that they were hoping to transfer to University
of New Mexico to finish up like an engineering degree so they could do 2
years at the tribal college and earn an associate\'s degree and some
stop there, which is fine, right? And then some would.\
Yeah, go on to four year university.

**Cooper, Ryan** 7:50\
Yeah, I would imagine that empathy for students kind of translate like
and stayed with you as you meet with. Yeah, I hope so.

**Pascal, Jennifer** 7:56\
I hope. I feel like, yeah, sometimes it gets frustrating, right? You\'re
just like, Oh my God, students, like, you know? But yeah, I I try to
remember, right? Like, we all have lives. Like, you know, it\'s a whole
iceberg thing, right? You don\'t see the whole picture.\
But sometimes, as we all know, it can be tough where you\'re just like,
why aren\'t you doing what you need to do?

**Cooper, Ryan** 8:22\
So you mentioned like you\'ve been doing more work with your colleagues
and experiential work. Like what are some passion projects that are
coming out of these out of this work?

**Pascal, Jennifer** 8:33\
Yeah, so one is the brewing, the UConn Brewing Innovation. We have a
course called Brew Crew, which is really fun. We have 60 students per
semester from all different majors across campus and the students we we
talk about the not only like the brewing science and engineering.\
Side of things, but also a lot of the business aspects like marketing
and branding and students get to work with a brewery, Urban Lodge
Brewing Company. So we have guest speakers from.\
From Urban Lodge talk about you know like their their experiences in in
the industry and things like that. And so throughout the process the
students get to go to the their production facility and help brew.\
Two different beers and can them, as well as come up with the ideas for
like the branding piece of it, the name of it, what kinds of flavors
they want, some of the recipe development as well. So that\'s been
really, really fun.\
To work on and and again it\'s interdisciplinary. So you get to see
different aspects of you know that I wouldn\'t normally see, you know in
just teaching like an engineering, full on engineering or chemical
engineering course.

**Cooper, Ryan** 9:57\
Yeah, much more well-rounded like.\
I I guess experience for both you and the students, right?

**Pascal, Jennifer** 10:06\
Yeah, that\'s the hope. And then they get some hands on, you know,
experience too. Like they\'re in the brewery and you know, they put them
to work doing different things. So they get to see and getting to see
just like, you know, the scale of.\
Um, you know, production facility and things like that is pretty cool.

**Cooper, Ryan** 10:28\
Yeah. So how do you measure success? Like, what\'s your measure of
success for these for the course? Yeah.

**Pascal, Jennifer** 10:35\
Yeah, that\'s that\'s a great question. We do do. We survey them at the
end of the class and they write like a big reflection and everything
about, you know, what they, what they learned, what they think could be
improved and stuff like that. So we\'ve been iterating on this course
for, I don\'t know, I think this is like the 4th, 5th semester.\
We\'ve done it. So I think, yeah, the success is do we, you know, do we
give the students some sort of, you know, good experience that, you
know, they wouldn\'t normally, normally get in like a traditional
course?\
So yeah, measuring that. Yeah, I think the reflections help a lot. We,
you know, get good feedback every semester. I think too, like, you know,
the students just hearing their experiences too. We highlight some of
them.\
Throughout the semester as well, like what, you know, through LinkedIn
and things like that, like what they\'re excited about, what they\'re
learning. So yeah, I mean, we also, yeah, have like an event at the end
of each round of this class where we invite alumni.

**Cooper, Ryan** 11:41\
Yeah.

**Pascal, Jennifer** 11:49\
And I to come to the event and like the unveiling of the beers that have
been brewed. And so I think that\'s a good measure of success too, like
people show up for those events.

**Cooper, Ryan** 11:59\
Yeah.\
Yeah, exactly. Like there\'s a lot of interest and like, people are
excited about it. What? What do the students think about? Like, what do
they think success is in the course?

**Pascal, Jennifer** 12:13\
Yeah, I think from based on the reflections, I think for them it\'s a
lot of the hands-on aspect like in interacting with different, the
different instructors in the course that all come from different
backgrounds. So we have like myself and Pete Menard from, you know, kind
of the engineering perspective we have Jen Matthews.\
Matthew from like the business side of things and we have Dennis
D\'amico from the agricultural side. And so I think the students enjoy
seeing those different perspectives and learning from us. And then we
also again have like the urban lodge people too, the people that are
actually in the brewing industry.\
Talking to them and I I think they really enjoy, yeah, being in the
brewery, getting to work on the beer, getting to see it canned and
seeing some of their ideas come to life, right. They look on the can and
they\'re like, I was the one who suggested, you know, we put this on the
can or.\
I first suggested the flavor we want to put in this beer, so I think
that\'s pretty exciting to them. It\'s cool when they bring like friends
or family to the event at the end and they\'re showing off, you know,
everything and like talking about the beer and like what they learned,
so.

**Cooper, Ryan** 13:28\
Yeah, I to me that sounds like a huge measure of success is like
students bringing it out and sharing it with.

**Pascal, Jennifer** 13:29\
Cool.\
Yeah.

**Cooper, Ryan** 13:36\
People that they are excited to share with, you know, friends, family.

**Pascal, Jennifer** 13:40\
Yeah.

**Cooper, Ryan** 13:43\
What are some challenges of like you\'re working with breweries, with
UConn, with students, with different departments? What? What are
challenges that come up?

**Pascal, Jennifer** 13:46\
Yeah.\
Yeah, I feel like one of the biggest challenges, it tends to be
perception, right? So, you know, sometimes people are thinking like
beer, like you don\'t want to promote alcohol and drinking among
students and things like that, but.\
I feel like we really try to teach students about, you know, the merits
of brewing not only beer, but like we\'re hoping to incorporate other
beverages like coffee and kombucha and things like that, teaching them
that there is a science to it, that there\'s value in.\
This industry, it\'s also a big part of the Connecticut economy in our
state is like craft beer is a is a big deal. There\'s, you know, well
over 100 craft breweries in the state of Connecticut. So just teaching
them more about this industry and a lot of them are are interested in,
you know, potentially opening their own.\
Breweries one day or even just being a part of the industry in some way,
whether it\'s like the marketing side of things or the sales side of
things. So I think, yeah, kind of overcoming some of the potentially
negative perceptions of it has been a challenge, but I think.\
We\'ve been successful in that, like really highlighting that there is
value in the education and the experiential learning components to this.

**Cooper, Ryan** 15:15\
Yeah, yeah. And it\'s a you\'re supporting a craft beer industry, not a
a like a binge drinking sort of.

**Pascal, Jennifer** 15:21\
Not a yeah, no, that is definitely not what we want to promote. And
like, you know, it\'s yeah, it\'s it\'s more talking about how you can
responsibly enjoy different craft beverages or not like we never.\
People are never, you know, it\'s not part of the class to like drink
the beer or anything. You don\'t have to. So there\'s many other things
that you can work on with respect to it, so.

**Cooper, Ryan** 15:47\
Yeah, yeah. And you mentioned that there\'s that you\'re in the pipeline
is sort of like non-alcoholic kombucha or sorry, did you say, but
coffee? Yeah.

**Pascal, Jennifer** 15:54\
Yeah, coffee. Yeah, cause Urban Lodge is starting a a coffee program as
well. And so we\'re we\'re hoping, yeah, to partner with them on that.
So we can also have students that are maybe first year students that are
potentially interested in this area.\
You know, but they\'re not 21 yet, you know? So you can still learn a
lot from like brewing coffee and things like that, right? A lot of it
translates to be.

**Cooper, Ryan** 16:23\
Yeah, exactly. So how has like this? This is a big undertaking to get
like serve a service course like this into your teaching. How is how is
it affected all of your other teaching like your other courses?

**Pascal, Jennifer** 16:36\
Yeah. So I\'ve been, we\'ve been really fortunate because there\'s so
many, there\'s, you know, several instructors. So we each kind of take
little pieces of it. So it hasn\'t been like this huge, huge thing or a
heavy lift. One other thing that\'s also been amazing is.\
Jen Matthew, director of the Connecticut Center for Entrepreneurship and
Innovation. She has one of her admins that\'s dedicated like a certain
percentage of her time to UConn Brewing Innovation. So she is an
enormous help to the.\
Program. She basically helps with a lot of the logistics of the brew
crew class. Like without her, I think we would, we would be lost. So
she\'s a huge piece of it. And yeah, just having the different faculty.
So it\'s like, you know, I teach, you know, certain weeks.\
We\'re all involved, like at the production facility when they can and
things like that. But yeah, it\'s not, it\'s not a huge lift since
there\'s so many people involved. Yeah, it\'s been really nice.

**Cooper, Ryan** 17:46\
That\'s great. Yeah, it\'s great when a team like actually comes
together like this. They\'re so focused and many hands are making light
work.

**Pascal, Jennifer** 17:51\
Yeah.\
Yeah, it is good. Yeah. We seem to all collab, you know, work well
together. And yeah, there\'s, yeah, it works.

**Cooper, Ryan** 18:06\
And so have you have you used like concepts from this from this brewing
course in your other courses?

**Pascal, Jennifer** 18:14\
Yeah, that\'s a great question. Somewhat like our like chemical
engineering, our laboratory technician Landon and I have been running a
couple of semesters of basically a group of students helping to build
new.\
Experiments for one of our laboratories. So we found or we saw a
presentation Dan and I did, Dan Burkey and I did a few years ago at the
American Society for Engineering Education. That was basically where
this these faculty and students had built, you know, a pipe.\
Rack experiment and then a heat exchanger experiment. And so they had
papers about it, which was really cool. And so Landon started trying to
do this all by himself and realized like this is a ton of work. And so
we thought, well, we could make a class for this and students could get
some.\
Hands on experience and also in the meantime, like get these experiments
built. So that\'s been really, really fun. And I think that the
experiential piece of it is, yeah, what I\'m excited about with like
Brew Crew and you know, this class as well.

**Cooper, Ryan** 19:30\
Yeah, that\'s really cool. So it sounds like you\'re you\'re taking kind
of pieces of what that experiential course is. What is experiential
learning to you? Like what have you seen? What makes it different?

**Pascal, Jennifer** 19:44\
Yeah, I I think, yeah, the hands-on piece and learning about what\'s
going on, for example, like in the craft beer industry, like what is the
day-to-day like, what are the challenges that they face? And then on the
chemical engineering side, fundamentally just learning about.\
Like the students seeing students learn about like how to use a wrench
or or myself learning about different fittings for pipes and things like
that. Like this is, you know, like the nitty-gritty, like the hands-on
stuff that I think is important and is something that we don\'t
necessarily do the best job of teaching.\
Engineering school, like I think we\'re great at the theory and things
like that. But then when it comes to like the practical aspects of in
chemical engineering, let\'s say if a student goes to work at a chemical
plant, like understanding like how fluid is flowing through the plant.\
If something\'s leaking, what do you do? So I think those aspects are
important and trying to just get students to experience more of that I
think would be really helpful.

**Cooper, Ryan** 20:55\
Yeah, like take.

**Pascal, Jennifer** 20:55\
Yeah, being able to, yeah, and to build something potentially, right?
Like they see it from start to finish and then it\'s running and it\'s
really cool for them to see.

**Cooper, Ryan** 21:05\
Yeah, so they\'re they\'re taking like that chemical engineering domain
knowledge, but as they try to apply it and build something, they\'re
learning a lot more of like all the other things surrounding it.

**Pascal, Jennifer** 21:20\
Yeah, and me too. Like I it\'s not like I\'ve sat here and like built
these entire systems or anything like that, right. So it\'s it\'s been
really fun for Landon and I to learn a lot more. Pete Menard has helped
us some, you know, he has a ton of great experience and.\
He\'s helped us figure out different things and he has so much into
intuition and knowledge that, yeah, I think it\'s been, it\'s been
really nice, like engineering, you know, actually happening.

**Cooper, Ryan** 21:50\
Yeah, yeah, that\'s amazing.\
And so one thing I wanted to ask about was, so you have like
experiential and like a lot of passion for the courses that you\'re
building, but then you also are helping with administrative work in the
department. So what is?\
So First off, like what is? What is the role that you have like teacher
admin?

**Pascal, Jennifer** 22:15\
Yeah, yeah. I\'m associate department head in the department. So a lot
of my focus, I think, tends to be on the undergraduate program within
the department and ABET.\
Is a big piece of that as well. So yeah, so a lot of it is like
curriculum updates, things like that. Just the yeah, helping students if
with any like advising.

**Cooper, Ryan** 22:31\
Yep.

**Pascal, Jennifer** 22:47\
Challenges and needs as well as, yeah, trying to support, you know, the
department head and making decisions and things like that. So yeah,
it\'s fun. Again, I don\'t know. Chemical engineering is a great team of
people. So I feel like it\'s all very collaborative and.\
I work closely with the undergraduate program director, Christina
Wagstrom, on a lot of things. Yeah. And then and then Eva is kind of, as
you know, its own beast.

**Cooper, Ryan** 23:16\
Nice.\
Yes, yeah. Um.\
So I don\'t know. Probably a lot of people haven\'t directly dealt with
a bet other than emails saying like, hey, you need to deal with a bet.
So as the the head of the spear for a bet work.

**Pascal, Jennifer** 23:30\
Yeah.

**Cooper, Ryan** 23:40\
What is a typical like ABET workload?

**Pascal, Jennifer** 23:43\
Yeah, it tends to be really heavy kind of the year leading up to the
visit and then through the visit and then it kind of calms down a little
bit. So those five years in between, it\'s really like, you know, you
kind of have your collection cycle. So at the beginning of the semester
you have to kind of reach out to people.\
For the their syllabi and things like that. And then towards the end of
the semester you reach out to them for the reports and stuff like that.
So the workload like during the year isn\'t isn\'t crazy, it\'s just
it\'s more like being on top of all the little details of things, which
it can be tricky.\
Amongst all the other stuff we\'ve all got going on, so yeah.

**Cooper, Ryan** 24:26\
Yes, yeah, yeah. So it sounds like a bet is sort of this five year cycle
before like teaching and admin work as associate department head.

**Pascal, Jennifer** 24:33\
Yeah.\
Yeah.

**Cooper, Ryan** 24:41\
What is your typical day look like? And then like versus a week, like
day-to-day, week to week?

**Pascal, Jennifer** 24:48\
Yeah. Oh yeah. As you know, like days can vary wildly, right? Like
today, you know, it\'s like, I think, yeah, I\'m going 11 to like the
build the pipe rack with the students for a couple of hours. Then I
have.

**Cooper, Ryan** 24:54\
Yes.

**Pascal, Jennifer** 25:03\
Basically, I think just a series of meetings till like 4:00 or so
meetings about various things like we have a weekly kind of chemical
engineering staff and leader, you know, leadership meeting.\
That I\'ll go to and then working with. We also have undergraduate
students that are our ambassadors, so we have a meeting with them. So
they volunteer for things like the admitted students day and stuff like
that. And then, you know, tomorrow I\'m in.\
I\'m in lab and then I have a class after that, so that that\'s like
most of my day tomorrow. So it\'s like one day, you know, you could be
teaching a lot and other meetings, stuff like that. But yeah, and then
week to week it.

**Cooper, Ryan** 25:49\
Yeah.

**Pascal, Jennifer** 25:52\
Yeah, it kind of tends to be the same, I feel like.

**Cooper, Ryan** 25:58\
Lots of meetings and squeezing in classes in between them.

**Pascal, Jennifer** 25:58\
You know, yeah.\
Yeah, yeah. And prepping for classes too. Like I try to block off. I try
to block off like Fridays to to like prep for classes. And I\'m also
gonna start working on an online.\
Class through CETL for next fall. So I try to block off like that whole
day to just work on that stuff. Cause otherwise, like if you don\'t, yes
you know, if you don\'t block stuff off in your calendar like it will
get filled up, you know, with every little thing. So yeah, I I try to
block off some time for things because otherwise you don\'t get to.

**Cooper, Ryan** 26:30\
Immediately. Yeah.

**Pascal, Jennifer** 26:37\
Actually think about things and reflect and like do the work you need to
do to be a better teacher and everything. So I don\'t know.

**Cooper, Ryan** 26:47\
Yeah, no, I I know exactly what you mean. Um.

**Pascal, Jennifer** 26:47\
Yeah.\
Yeah, especially a sire faculty. You\'re teaching, you know, 3 courses
at least, you know, a semester usually. And that that takes up a ton of
time in and of itself. But you have to have time to prep too, right?

**Cooper, Ryan** 26:59\
Yeah.\
Yeah, so you you teach 3 courses each semester and then.\
And then also admin work.

**Pascal, Jennifer** 27:11\
Yeah.

**Cooper, Ryan** 27:12\
OK.\
Um. So then um.\
So I\'ll circle back to student like teaching kind of work. It it sounds
like you still have some courses that are more theory-based but also
experiential courses. How do you communicate like feedback to the? Do
you have the same feedback method for both?

**Pascal, Jennifer** 27:38\
Mhm.

**Cooper, Ryan** 27:41\
For different ways.

**Pascal, Jennifer** 27:43\
Yeah, I think it\'s a little bit different. Like the the more kind of
like core undergraduate chemical engineering courses is kind of a little
bit more traditional, right? Like, you know, some quizzes and homeworks
and things like that.\
Whereas I think for the experiential courses, it\'s more about
reflections and yeah, communicating, you know what like communicating
what they\'ve learned and what they\'re working on, especially like with
the the building of the experiments every.\
Single session, the students have to write, you know what what they did,
are there challenges they\'re facing, what do they need from us? So and
then Landon and I kind of go through that and give them feedback on
that, answer questions, things like that.\
So yeah, I do feel like it\'s different in these experiential courses,
yeah. Um.

**Cooper, Ryan** 28:36\
No.\
Yeah, yeah, that is very different.\
So a lot more reflection in an experience based course experiential.

**Pascal, Jennifer** 28:45\
I feel like that like, I mean you can obviously do that in more the
more, you know, traditional engineering courses as well. But I feel like
I I tend to do less of that. It\'s like you know this balance of rigor
and.\
Um, you know, reflection and things like that. Reflection can be
rigorous too, but yeah.

**Cooper, Ryan** 29:09\
Yeah.\
So as you\'re looking through reflections, like what are, what are
examples where you find like, oh wow, this student\'s really connecting
and doing a great job versus reflections where it.

**Pascal, Jennifer** 29:26\
Yeah.

**Cooper, Ryan** 29:27\
You feel like, oh, is there a way to get this student more involved?

**Pascal, Jennifer** 29:31\
Yeah, that\'s a good question and good point. I definitely do see that.
And so you know, if I see that, especially in small, the smaller
classes, right, it\'s a lot easier because you, you know the student and
you.\
Can actually talk to them and try to get them more involved. I feel like
in a class like Brew Crew, we do keep track of that kind of thing.
There\'s 60 students and so it can be a little trickier cause they\'re
all from different majors too. So it\'s like I don\'t, I don\'t know
them like whereas in a smaller class that\'s in chemical engineering.\
I know all of them, so it\'s very easy for me to go and chat with them
and ask them what\'s going on or whatever. But in a larger class,
that\'s definitely a bit more challenging, but we do still keep track of
it, like if we\'ve noticed a student hasn\'t turned in assignments or
they\'re not.\
Putting, you know, not writing a whole lot like it\'s something, yeah,
we keep our aware of and then try to pull that student aside the next,
you know, class and talk with them. We\'ve done that before, but yeah.

**Cooper, Ryan** 30:37\
Yeah, and it seems like a good method for intervention.

**Pascal, Jennifer** 30:38\
So.\
Yeah, like we haven\'t had too much of that in Brew Cruise, maybe just
been one or two students. It\'s usually just, you know, they\'ve got
other stuff going on is what it amounts to, so.

**Cooper, Ryan** 30:55\
Yeah, yeah, exactly. Like balancing priorities for, or at least like
learning to balance priorities. That\'s sort of what college is about,
right?

**Pascal, Jennifer** 30:55\
You know.\
Mhm.\
Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

**Cooper, Ryan** 31:09\
It sounds like you have your your department has a great community. Do
you have other places where you find like community for?

**Pascal, Jennifer** 31:22\
Yeah, yeah. The obviously the department is great. And then through the
chemical engineering education community like education division through
ASWE or the American Institute of Chemical Engineers is generally like
very nice community I do.

**Cooper, Ryan** 31:23\
For your role.

**Pascal, Jennifer** 31:41\
A couple of things, you know, I have a couple of roles in those
communities and they\'re wonderful, really supportive, collaborative. So
yeah, I feel like that\'s those are kind of the biggest places and also
whimsy.\
Women in math, you know, science, engineering faculty group is really
great too. I just got on the organizing committee for that and that\'s
been really fun.\
Um, working with that? Yeah, getting to know people better, so.

**Cooper, Ryan** 32:08\
That\'s great.\
What are the roles that you had for chemical engineering education and
AS EE?

**Pascal, Jennifer** 32:20\
Yeah, right now for the Chemical Engineering Society, I\'m the
membership chair of the membership committee. So and we like everybody,
we all kind of meet as different committee heads once a month to kind of
update people on things and.\
Yeah. So last year, yeah, I worked, have a couple people on the
committee and we worked together. We made like stickers and pens and
bookmarks and things like that to try to get the word out about the
education division and how it can be beneficial to anyone, no matter,
you know, what their role is at.\
As a faculty member, so.

**Cooper, Ryan** 33:00\
Yeah, you don\'t have to be a strictly teaching faculty to to benefit
from teaching pedagogy, right?

**Pascal, Jennifer** 33:03\
Yeah.\
Benefit from exactly right. That\'s the idea.

**Cooper, Ryan** 33:11\
Yeah.\
Um, very cool. And was there anything else that you wanted to talk about
today like or?\
Parting thoughts.

**Pascal, Jennifer** 33:29\
Oh my gosh, no, this is great. Thank you and thank you all for coming.
And if I\'m always happy to chat about any anything or you know, brewing
innovation, et cetera. I think also I do think this community is great
as well, the Sire community at in UConn and the College of Engineering.\
I know like the last couple of semesters, I like my I\'ve had time
conflicts with some of the meetings and stuff, but the first several
years I was here, I was, yeah, at all the meetings and stuff. It\'s
it\'s been really, really.\
Helpful as well. So definitely don\'t want to downplay that. Like being
involved in this community is is great. Like that\'s how I met you,
Ryan. You know, for example Sarira, like it\'s how I\'ve met everyone in
this room. Otherwise it wouldn\'t probably wouldn\'t have happened,
right? So.

**Cooper, Ryan** 34:10\
Yep.

**Pascal, Jennifer** 34:19\
I think, yeah, keeping this going is is super important, so I appreciate
the work you\'re doing.

**Cooper, Ryan** 34:19\
Yeah.\
Yeah, like as our like sire kind of community. I know it keeps changing
names like but the the general sort of in residence community. It\'s
amazing cause you can talk to any in residence.

**Pascal, Jennifer** 34:32\
I know.

**Cooper, Ryan** 34:43\
Across any department and even like different schools and colleges and
there\'s all like similar sort of goals and like.\
And method like everyone wants to talk about like different methods and
things. It feels a little different from like siloed research. So like
sometime it depends on the researchers, but some researchers can kind of
hole up and decide like no, I don\'t.

**Pascal, Jennifer** 34:58\
Yeah.\
Yeah.

**Cooper, Ryan** 35:11\
I don\'t wanna talk to anyone else. I\'m gonna do my thing.

**Pascal, Jennifer** 35:15\
Yeah, I agree. I feel like the the teaching focused faculty across
campus in general have, yeah, are always very collaborative and.\
Excited to share ideas and things so.\
I agree. Yeah, it is. It is a very good community.

**Cooper, Ryan** 35:35\
Yeah, cool.\
And so it\'s been both of us talking, but and I didn\'t see any anything
pop up for questions, but I did want to open up. Were there other
questions from audience?

**Pascal, Jennifer** 35:42\
Yeah.

**Baig, Hasan** 35:53\
Yeah, I do have a question actually. I was waiting for you to ask. I did
not know whether I was supposed to be timing in, but I have a question
regarding the courses that you mentioned, reflection based courses. So
how do you gauge student success and how do you ensure that they?

**Pascal, Jennifer** 35:54\
Yeah.

**Baig, Hasan** 36:13\
Remain like feel active in the class and whatever you are carrying out.

**Pascal, Jennifer** 36:18\
Yeah. So, yeah, for really the main course that we use the reflections
in is the the one where they\'re building, helping build the
experiments. So I think the measure of success there is like they\'re
showing up for an hour or two hours. Like are they, are they doing
something? Are they engaged? Are they?\
Um, do they, you know?\
Have hands on equipment and things like that. And yeah, there\'s
definitely times where some of them might might not be. And then, you
know, I think reaching out to them and just going up to them and be
like, hey, what are you doing? Or like, do you want to help work on this
and stuff like that. And in general, these these students really want
the hands-on experience and they\'re really excited.\
To build something. So it hasn\'t been too much of an issue. So I think
gauging success is like, see, you know, just even observing their
excitement about what they\'re doing day-to-day.

**Baig, Hasan** 37:13\
Is it like lab lab based quarters all of them?

**Pascal, Jennifer** 37:17\
Just this one in particular. It\'s yeah, I guess you could kind of call
it a lab because there are they are there like every session building,
like trying troubleshooting equipment essentially and trying to figure
out how it fits together. What tools do they need? What supplies do they
need?\
Basically, yeah, we ran into an issue earlier this week where I think
for one experiment they had used like a certain size of support, whereas
they were supposed to use it for this experiment. And so they\'re like,
well, what do we do? Do we cut it? Do we leave it as it is and then
adjust the design? And so, like, we were just brainstorming.\
Storming with all of them. Like, what are the options? Let\'s try this
first. See what we get. Um, yeah.

**Baig, Hasan** 38:03\
It\'s interesting. So I wanted to have your feedback on like how do you
manage like these large amount of students and do you have any support
for using that?

**Pascal, Jennifer** 38:12\
Yeah. So the building class, we limit to like 12 students. So like, you
know, it\'s not that big and they come, they can come at different times
too. So you know, one one hour you might have like six of them, another
hour, you know, you might have four with the Brew crew with 60 students.

**Baig, Hasan** 38:18\
Yeah.

**Pascal, Jennifer** 38:32\
We split them up into two teams of 30. So on the brew days you\'ve got
30 students on this day brewing in the brew production facility and the
next day you have 30. And so the support is that we have.\
Gosh, how many? We have 1235 faculty basically on this course. And then
also the admin that dedicates, you know, a percentage of her time to
helping with the class. So it\'s a lot of support. Otherwise, yeah, we
would. I couldn\'t do this like on my own. There\'s no way with
everything.\
So I think that\'s key is like, you know, finding if you\'re going to do
something like this, like, you know, it\'s good to find other other
people to work with to help. Yeah, lessen the load and also it\'s just
good to have.

**Baig, Hasan** 39:19\
Great. Thanks.

**Pascal, Jennifer** 39:23\
Of different perspectives in a course like that.

**Baig, Hasan** 39:27\
Trusting. Thank. Thank you very much.

**Pascal, Jennifer** 39:28\
Yeah.

**Cooper, Ryan** 39:51\
I was giving a little bit of time for people to think of, like, stop and
think.

**Baig, Hasan** 39:53\
Yeah.

**Pascal, Jennifer** 39:57\
Like with students, when you stand there and you\'re like, I\'m not
afraid to keep till somebody says something.

**Sherafat, Ellie** 40:14\
I have a question.

**Pascal, Jennifer** 40:15\
Yes.

**Sherafat, Ellie** 40:18\
Hi, Jennifer. Thank you so much for for this talk. So my question is
this, so for for your students, so how you ensure you give them skills
that is needed for industry and then what your department does to create
those collaborations with industry. So do you have some resources
already or do you have some connections?

**Pascal, Jennifer** 40:19\
OK.

**Sherafat, Ellie** 40:38\
Or it\'s usually like their last year. I\'m just wondering how it\'s
working in your department.

**Pascal, Jennifer** 40:43\
Yeah, that is a great question and I would love to hear ideas of what
people are doing in their departments with respect to this, because I
feel like that\'s something that we are trying to improve within our
department for sure. So in terms of, yeah, working with industry, I
know.\
Like Genesis here and Monica are kind of in charge of our current senior
design sequence. In the past couple of years, they\'ve really done a lot
of work on recruiting sponsored senior design projects from a lot of our
alumni that are in industry and also bringing.\
Bringing them to campus to speak to the students about about their roles
in industry. Additionally, we do have surveys from like we did a survey
like a year ago of like a lot of our alumni that are in industry and the
types of skills that they.\
Deemed to be, you know, important and what they wish they had learned
like at UConn in chemical engineering, like what we should teach more of
to prepare them better for industry. So we\'ve used that to inform some
curriculum changes. One of the biggest things was really focusing on
those professional skills.\
You know, they felt they were prepared, you know, most of the time, like
technically, but the professional skills, like giving presentations,
writing memos, all of that sort of thing. So we made three one credit
hour professional skills courses.\
To be offered sophomore, junior and senior year to help prepare students
better with some of those skills. And then we\'re in the process of
incorporating some other things into the curriculum too based on those
surveys. But yeah, I mean in terms, I think that\'s a challenge for
sure. So I would love.\
Your all\'s, your all\'s ideas about that as well, like what your
departments are doing.\
So I always think it could be better.

**Sherafat, Ellie** 42:44\
Thank you so much about the course that you said is a three credit
course and then and then how you run it. So you bring industry to
introduce like what they need or just what kind of skills from your
major they need in their like their industry work or.

**Pascal, Jennifer** 42:58\
Yeah, yeah. So it\'s actually, it\'s a one credit class the sophomore
year, one credit class junior year and A1 credit class senior year. And
so the idea is to kind of have the skills be appropriate for the level
of students. So sophomore year it\'s.\
About more about professional communication, resume writing, things like
that. Whereas, you know, they\'re trying to potentially get internships.
And then junior year, yeah, you know, a little, a little more focused on
like technical communication and things like that.\
And so, yeah, I I haven\'t taught any. I\'m teaching one of the courses
next year, but there are speakers from industry that do come and talk to
the students and also people from the Career Center at UConn as well.\
As far as I know, like we\'re still, we\'re still kind of in the process
of rolling these out. So this is the first time like one of the classes
is being offered. So yeah, we\'re kind of taking it as it comes sort
of.\
Yeah.

**Sherafat, Ellie** 44:09\
Thank you so much.

**Pascal, Jennifer** 44:11\
Yeah.

**Cooper, Ryan** 44:18\
The Career Center here at UConn is is awesome. Just like seconding that
it is a great resource and like Speaking of like students.

**Pascal, Jennifer** 44:23\
Yeah.\
It is a yeah.

**Cooper, Ryan** 44:31\
Like telling you, hey, this is what I wasn\'t prepared for. The Career
Center has shown me kind of data of like what the student thinks
they\'re prepared for versus what industry says they\'re prepared for.
And one of, I think one of them was like professionalism, just a general
sort of like how professional you are.

**Pascal, Jennifer** 44:43\
Yeah.\
Yeah.

**Cooper, Ryan** 44:50\
Students go into the workforce thinking they\'re 10 out of 10
professionals, professionals and the industry sort of rates them at like
a two out of like just so much lower. They\'re so confident and ready
and yet just not at all.

**Pascal, Jennifer** 44:59\
Yes, yeah.\
Yeah.\
Maybe not. Yeah, I think we have the Career Center or the sophomore year
kind of do that exercise with them. The exact thing like, yeah, they
self rate like on certain career competency areas. So like, yeah, a lot
of the professional skills is kind of.\
Through the lens of the NACE career competencies that we have the Career
Center, yeah. And obviously Theo is a wonderful resource. Like I\'ve had
him come talk to several classes and he gives great advice and.\
Yeah.

**Cooper, Ryan** 45:41\
Yeah, Theo Menounos is our Um Engineering Career Center kind of
connection. He\'s our main contact point for.

**Pascal, Jennifer** 45:43\
Yes.

**Cooper, Ryan** 45:51\
So he\'s a great if students come to you asking for like resume help,
you usually like it\'s great if you can spend time and help them with a
resume, but there\'s also a lot of just general career searching advice.

**Pascal, Jennifer** 45:58\
Yeah.

**Cooper, Ryan** 46:09\
That Theo is like a master at dealing with. So send send students his
way as you\'re kind of looking for. I\'m I\'m just kind of telling
everybody else. I think, Jen, you know.

**Pascal, Jennifer** 46:13\
Yeah.\
No, but no, he\'s fantastic. Like, yeah, I know a lot of students.
They\'re like, that\'s how I got my internship or my job was like
working with Theo. He helped me. So I think, yeah, he\'s a really,
really good resource. We\'re lucky to have him.\
In the in the College of Engineering.

**Cooper, Ryan** 46:39\
Yeah.\
Give it another 30 more seconds and then we can wrap up and get to the
next meetings, the next meeting.

**Pascal, Jennifer** 46:58\
Right, the next things.

**Cooper, Ryan** 47:13\
OK. Thanks again, Jen. This was really awesome. Like it was great to
hear because I\'ve been following the the UConn Brewing initiative and
like I I want to hear more like I want to know the ins and outs. So it
was really awesome to hear like how you deal with it and like the team
that.

**Pascal, Jennifer** 47:20\
Thank you all.\
Yeah.

**Cooper, Ryan** 47:33\
Supporting you and also cool to hear about like what the transition what
because you went from like a postdoc doing teaching work and now you\'re
kind of administrative plus teaching work for the depart like you\'re
kind of the.

**Pascal, Jennifer** 47:43\
Yeah.\
Yeah.

**Cooper, Ryan** 47:51\
Running a lot of work that happens at the department. So it\'s really
cool to hear how you balance that, but still keeping like these passion
projects and like work, yeah.

**Pascal, Jennifer** 48:01\
Yeah, and I think that\'s a challenge we all face. Yeah, as sire faculty
and yeah, so and yeah, another really good resource I didn\'t know. I
people may already know about this, but this is how like UConn Brewing
Innovation really got started was I don\'t have the link to the website,
but.\
Greenhouse Studios has. I don\'t know. Yeah, they\'re in the library.
Like, I didn\'t know they existed until they they heard about what Pete
Menard and I were like trying to do with the Brewing Innovation program
and they can. Then that\'s how we got connected to.\
Other people on campus and like really started this whole thing. So
their their their thing is all about like, you know, ideating like new
innovative ideas that are on campus and bringing people together to, you
know.\
Bring those like so those come to fruition. So that\'s another great
resource if you haven\'t. I again had no idea about it until.\
You know, they reached out. So right, right, exactly.

**Cooper, Ryan** 49:06\
Five years ago, I guess. Yeah, when it.\
That\'s so cool. And thanks everyone for joining. Oh, sorry, go ahead.

**Pascal, Jennifer** 49:13\
Yeah. So, yeah. Thank you. No, thank you. See you all later. Thank you.

**Baig, Hasan** 49:16\
Thank you very much, forever. Thank you very much.

**Cooper, Ryan** 49:18\
Thank you so much. This was great.

**Baig, Hasan** 49:20\
Yeah, bye.

**Pascal, Jennifer** 49:23\
Thank you. Bye.

**Baig, Hasan** 49:23\
Thanks. Thanks, Ryan.

**Pascal, Jennifer** 49:25\
Thanks, Ryan.
